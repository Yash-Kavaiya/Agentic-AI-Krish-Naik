# Building Agentic AI
### A Free Course by Krish C Naik

## Course Overview
This comprehensive course introduces you to the exciting world of Agentic AI, teaching you how to build autonomous AI applications using modern frameworks. You'll learn to create AI agents that can learn, make decisions, and solve complex problems independently.

## What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI represents the next evolution in artificial intelligence - systems that can operate autonomously with minimal human supervision. These AI agents possess three key capabilities:

1. **Learning and Adaptation**: They continuously learn from experiences and feedback, adjusting their behavior to handle new situations effectively.

2. **Decision Making**: They comprehend user objectives and contextual information to make informed decisions independently.

3. **Complex Problem Solving**: They can manage intricate tasks, execute multi-step processes, and independently access and utilize resources.

## Course Tools and Frameworks
We will be working with several cutting-edge frameworks:
- Langflow: For building visual language processing workflows
- Phidata: For data processing and analysis
- Langgraph: For creating complex AI interaction graphs
- Autogen: For generating autonomous AI agents

## Real-World Applications
Throughout the course, we'll explore how Agentic AI is transforming various industries:

### Healthcare
